            #### [Gannon McGibbon](https://gannon.io/)

            Note:
            - For WRUG April 2025

            ## üëã Hi, I'm Gannon

            ![Gannon](images/me.jpg)

            - Works at Shopify
            - Committer on Ruby on Rails
            - Organizes Winnipeg.rb

            Note:
            - Intro
            ---
            ## Who here has a website?

            # üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
            ---
            ## Is it a server-side web application?

            # üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
            ---
            ## Does anyone deploy web apps at work?

            # üôã
            ---
            ## I have a website

            # üë®‚Äçüíª

            Note:
            - I have a website
            - It is hosted on Heroku
            - I pay for that, monthly
            ---
            ## Heroku is a PaaS

            ```sh
            > heroku git:remote -a my-app
            > git push heroku main
            > ‚úÖ
            ```

            Note:
            - Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS)
            - You add a git origin and push
            - Your app is deployed. Very simple
            ---
            ## This is my Blog

            ![My Website](images/blog.png)

            Note:
            - It showcases my talks and blog posts
            - I could use a static site, but I don't want to
            - I love using Rails too much
            ---
            ## This is my Blog

            ![My Website](images/blog.png)

            Note:
            - I also love finding bugs
            - A big reason I maintain this app is to find bugs
            - I've found 1 in Ruby and several in Rails
            ---
            ## I ‚ù§Ô∏è Heroku

            ![Heroku](images/heroku.svg)

            Note:
            - I also love Heroku
            - It is probably the best
            - Maybe oldest PaaS service out there
            ---
            ## Convenience

            ![Heroku](images/heroku.svg)

            Note:
            - The biggest strength of Heroku
            - And other PaaS providers like it
            - is convenience
            ---
            ## Convenience

            ![Dynos](images/dynos.png)

            Note:
            - Servers are abstracted away into dynos
            - If you need more servers, buy more dynos
            - If you need better servers, buy beefier dynos
            ---
            ## Convenience

            ![Redis](images/add-on-redis.png)

            Note:
            - Services are packaged into composible add-ons
            - Need Redis? No problem
            - Just select a tier
            ---
            ## Convenience

            ![Bugsnag](images/add-on-bugsnag.png)

            Note:
            - How about bug tracking? They've got that too
            - Most of the time, it just works
            - Provisioning is quck, and you client libraries do the rest
            ---
            ## Convenience

            ![Penguin](images/penguin.svg)

            Note:
            - Server administration is completely gone
            - You don't know what os you are using
            - You don't need to worry about security patches
            ---
            ## Convenience

            ![Maintenance Email](images/maintenance-email.png)

            Note:
            - If they need to update something critical to your app
            - They'll let you know
            - Most of the time they can do this for you
            ---
            ## Convenience

            ![Deploy](images/deploy.png)

            Note:
            - Deploys are so easy
            - You can deploy by simply pushing a branch to git
            - Or via docker using a container command
            ---
            ## Rails World 2024

            ![Rails World](images/rails-world.png)

            Note:
            - Last year, during Rails World
            - DHH brought up PaaS
            - And talked about the companies behind these services
            - And what they want you to think
            ---
            ## Rails World 2024

            ![Confused](images/confused.jpg)

            Note:
            - They want you to think managing servers is hard
            - They want you to be scared of hackers
            - They want you to think you can't do it yourself
            ---
            ## Rails World 2024

            ![Rails World Talk QR](images/rails-world-talk-qr.png)

            Note:
            - It is an excellent talk
            - You should watch it
            - I've been thinking about this for a few months
            - I've also been looking at my server bills
            ---
            ## Cost effectiveness

            # üí≤

            Note:
            - The clearest drawback to PaaS by far
            - Is cost effectiveness
            ---
            ## Cost effectiveness

            - I pay $7USD per month for 1 worker dyno
            - That's $84USD per year
            - That's ~$125CAD per year

            Note:
            - I pay 7 USD per month per dyno
            - That's $84 USD per year
            - Using my bank's current conversion rate
            - That's roughly $125CAD per year
            ---
            ## Cost effectiveness

            - I pay $7USD per month for 1 worker dyno
            - That's $84USD per year
            - That's ~$125CAD per year

            Note:
            - That's not a lot
            - But what if I need to host another app?
            - This came up just last year
            - $125 per app per year + services + domains
            ---
            ## Cost effectiveness

            # ‚öíÔ∏è

            Note:
            - I tried hosting multiple apps on a single dyno
            - It didn't end well
            - Memory pressure was a bit high
            - You're fighting against the system
            ---
            ## Virtual Private Servers

            ![Digital Ocean](images/digital-ocean.svg)

            Note:
            - Many of you know of a Virtual Private Server (VPS)
            - A virtualized server on a rack somewhere
            - Much better value, renting raw compute
            ---
            ## Virtual Private Servers

            - $4USD per month for 1 VPS server
            - That's $48USD per year
            - That's $70CAD per year

            Note:
            - Because you're not paying for software
            - The cheapest VPS from DO costs $4USD per month
            - It has more compute than heroku's basic dynos
            ---
            ## Virtual Private Servers

            - $4USD per month for 1 VPS server
            - That's $48USD per year
            - That's $70CAD per year

            Note:
            - This a much better price
            - And more scale-friendly
            - You can deploy multiple apps on VPS
            ---
            ## The Problem

            # üí∏

            Note:
            - So, I can save money by switching to VPS
            - But how do we deploy to a VPS?
            - And how do we serve our app with a VPS?
            ---
            ## The Problem

            # üöÄ

            Note:
            - With lower prices come unsolved problems
            - There's many ways to deploy an app
            - There's many ways to serve an app
            ---
            ## The Problem

            # ‚ùì

            Note:
            - So, how do we get the best of both?
            - I want convient deployments
            - And I don't want to overpay for compute
            ---
            ## Kamal

            ![Kamal](images/kamal.webp)

            Note:
            - This is where Kamal comes in
            - Kamal is basically an SSH deploy tool that uses Docker
            - It offers the simplicity of a PaaS, on any server
            ---
            ## Kamal

            ![Kamal Docs](images/kamal-docs.png)

            Note:
            - I'll be using Rails for reference
            - But you can deploy any web app with Kamal
            - To any Debian server reachable over SSH
            ---
            ## Kamal

            ![Kamal Docs](images/kamal-docs.png)

            Note:
            - Rails 8 ships with Kamal, hence DHH's keynote
            - For legacy apps, you need to wire it yourself
            - But it isn't too hard
            ---
            ## My Blog

            - Started on Rails 7, on edge
            - Started on Ruby 3, on 3.4.2
            - Runs a subset of Rails

            Note:
            - My app runs on Rails edge
            - It uses Ruby 3.4.2
            - Only uses a few Rails gems
            - It doesn't load Active Record, Active Storage, etc.
            ---
            ## My Blog

            # ‚ùÑÔ∏è

            Note:
            - A bit of a unique setup
            - Good for finding bugs, but a pain to upgrade
            - We need to wire up Kamal ourselves
            ---
            ## Setup

            ![VPS Security Post](images/vps-security.png)

            Note:
            - But before we do that, we should secure our server
            - This blog post provides a few different ways
            - However, the most important part is securing SSH
            ---
            ## Setup

            ![VPS Security QR](images/vps-security-qr.png)

            Note:
            - Most VPS providers allow you to add an SSH key upon creation
            - This sidesteps most of the problem
            - But it still a good idea to do more
            ---
            ## Setup

            ```sh
            > sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade -y
            > sudo apt install ufw
            > sudo apt install fail2ban
            ```

            Note:
            - Things like keeping packages updated
            - Using a firewall like ufw
            - Using an IP banning tool like fail2ban
            - For a hobby project, I'm not doing much more than this
            ---
            ## Setup

            ```docker[]
            ARG RUBY_VERSION=3.4.1
            FROM docker.io/library/ruby:$RUBY_VERSION-slim
            WORKDIR /rails
            ENV RAILS_ENV="production" \
                BUNDLE_DEPLOYMENT="1" \
                BUNDLE_PATH="/usr/local/bundle" \
                BUNDLE_WITHOUT="development"
            COPY . .
            COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock ./
            RUN bundle install && \
                bundle exec bootsnap precompile --gemfile
            RUN groupadd --system --gid 1000 rails && \
                useradd rails --uid 1000 --gid 1000 \
                --create-home --shell /bin/bash && \
                chown -R rails:rails db log tmp
            USER 1000:1000
            EXPOSE 80
            CMD ["./bin/thrust", "./bin/rails", "server"]
            ```

            Note:
            - Now we can get into application setup
            - We need to first add a dockerfile
            - It is what kamal uses to build your app
            - This is an shorter version of it
            ---
            ## Setup

            ```docker[1-3]
            ARG RUBY_VERSION=3.4.1
            FROM docker.io/library/ruby:$RUBY_VERSION-slim
            WORKDIR /rails
            ENV RAILS_ENV="production" \
                BUNDLE_DEPLOYMENT="1" \
                BUNDLE_PATH="/usr/local/bundle" \
                BUNDLE_WITHOUT="development"
            COPY . .
            COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock ./
            RUN bundle install && \
                bundle exec bootsnap precompile --gemfile
            RUN groupadd --system --gid 1000 rails && \
                useradd rails --uid 1000 --gid 1000 \
                --create-home --shell /bin/bash && \
                chown -R rails:rails db log tmp
            USER 1000:1000
            EXPOSE 80
            CMD ["./bin/thrust", "./bin/rails", "server"]
            ```

            Note:
            - The first part is standard
            - We setup a Ruby version to use
            - Our source image
            - And the working directory
            ---
            ## Setup

            ```docker[4-9]
            ARG RUBY_VERSION=3.4.1
            FROM docker.io/library/ruby:$RUBY_VERSION-slim
            WORKDIR /rails
            ENV RAILS_ENV="production" \
                BUNDLE_DEPLOYMENT="1" \
                BUNDLE_PATH="/usr/local/bundle" \
                BUNDLE_WITHOUT="development"
            COPY . .
            COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock ./
            RUN bundle install && \
                bundle exec bootsnap precompile --gemfile
            RUN groupadd --system --gid 1000 rails && \
                useradd rails --uid 1000 --gid 1000 \
                --create-home --shell /bin/bash && \
                chown -R rails:rails db log tmp
            USER 1000:1000
            EXPOSE 80
            CMD ["./bin/thrust", "./bin/rails", "server"]
            ```

            Note:
            - Next up we set environment variables
            - And copy over the app and its gemfile
            ---
            ## Setup

            ```docker[10-16]
            ARG RUBY_VERSION=3.4.1
            FROM docker.io/library/ruby:$RUBY_VERSION-slim
            WORKDIR /rails
            ENV RAILS_ENV="production" \
                BUNDLE_DEPLOYMENT="1" \
                BUNDLE_PATH="/usr/local/bundle" \
                BUNDLE_WITHOUT="development"
            COPY . .
            COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock ./
            RUN bundle install && \
                bundle exec bootsnap precompile --gemfile
            RUN groupadd --system --gid 1000 rails && \
                useradd rails --uid 1000 --gid 1000 \
                --create-home --shell /bin/bash && \
                chown -R rails:rails db log tmp
            USER 1000:1000
            EXPOSE 80
            CMD ["./bin/thrust", "./bin/rails", "server"]
            ```

            Note:
            - Then we install dependencies
            - Setup bootsnap, which make it boot faster
            - and then fix some permissions
            ---
            ## Setup

            ```docker[17-18]
            ARG RUBY_VERSION=3.4.1
            FROM docker.io/library/ruby:$RUBY_VERSION-slim
            WORKDIR /rails
            ENV RAILS_ENV="production" \
                BUNDLE_DEPLOYMENT="1" \
                BUNDLE_PATH="/usr/local/bundle" \
                BUNDLE_WITHOUT="development"
            COPY . .
            COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock ./
            RUN bundle install && \
                bundle exec bootsnap precompile --gemfile
            RUN groupadd --system --gid 1000 rails && \
                useradd rails --uid 1000 --gid 1000 \
                --create-home --shell /bin/bash && \
                chown -R rails:rails db log tmp
            USER 1000:1000
            EXPOSE 80
            CMD ["./bin/thrust", "./bin/rails", "server"]
            ```

            Note:
            - Finally we set the entrypoint and the port
            - The entrypoint will migrate the DB
            - And run the server with thrust
            ---
            ## Setup

            ```sh
            > bundle add thruster
            Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/..........
            Resolving dependencies...
            Fetching thruster 0.1.12 (x86_64-linux)
            Installing thruster 0.1.12 (x86_64-linux)
            ```
            ```sh
            > bundle binstubs thruster
            ```

            Note:
            - Next up, we need to add thruster
            - This is a thin proxy that runs in front of your app server
            - You don't need it, but it will make your app faster
            - It provides simple caching, automatic TLS, and more
            ---
            ## Setup

            ```rb
            # config/routes.rb

            Rails.application.routes.draw do
              get "up", to: "rails/health#show",
                  as: :rails_health_check
              # ...
            end
            ```

            Note:
            - Then comes the route
            - Kamal needs to a way to talk to your app
            - This health check route lets Kamal know when the app is ready
            - Without this, Kamal can't verify deploy success
            ---
            ## Setup

            ```yml[]
            service: blog
            image: gmcgibbon/blog
            servers:
              web:
                - 1.234.56.78
            proxy:
              ssl: true
              host: gannon.io
            registry:
              username: gmcgibbon
              password:

                - RAILS_MASTER_KEY
            asset_path: /rails/public/assets
            ```

            Note:
            - Finally, we have the config file
            - This tells kamal how to deploy your app
            - Let's step through it
            ---

            ## Setup

            ```yml[1-5]
            service: blog
            image: gmcgibbon/blog
            servers:
              web:
                - 1.234.56.78
            proxy:
              ssl: true
              host: gannon.io
            registry:
              username: gmcgibbon
              password:
                - KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD
            builder:
              arch: amd64
            env:
              clear:
                RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES: 1
              secret:
                - RAILS_MASTER_KEY
            asset_path: /rails/public/assets
            ```

            Note:
            - First we speciy a service name
            - The name of the docker image
            - Your servers organized by worker type
            ---
            ## Setup

            ```yml[6-14]
            service: blog
            image: gmcgibbon/blog
            servers:
              web:
                - 1.234.56.78
            proxy:
              ssl: true
              host: gannon.io
            registry:
              username: gmcgibbon
              password:
                - KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD
            builder:
              arch: amd64
            env:
              clear:
                RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES: 1
              secret:
                - RAILS_MASTER_KEY
            asset_path: /rails/public/assets
            ```

            Note:
            - Next we're setting proxy info, turning on HTTPS and our domain
            - The registry username and password to use
            - Along with the target arch to build the image for
            ---
            ## Setup

            ```yml[15-20]
            service: blog
            image: gmcgibbon/blog
            servers:
              web:
                - 1.234.56.78
            proxy:
              ssl: true
              host: gannon.io
            registry:
              username: gmcgibbon
            password:
              - KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD
            builder:
              arch: amd64
            env:
              clear:
                RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES: 1
              secret:
                - RAILS_MASTER_KEY
            asset_path: /rails/public/assets
            ```

            Note:
            - Next there's environment configuration
            - Static files can be served on a VPS
            - We also need to specify a master key secret to decrypt credentials
            - We also set the path to assets because are serving assets this way
            ---
            ## Setup

            ```yml[15-20]
            service: blog
            image: gmcgibbon/blog
            servers:
              web:
                - 1.234.56.78
            proxy:
              ssl: true
              host: gannon.io
            registry:
              username: gmcgibbon
            password:
              - KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD
            builder:
              arch: amd64
            env:
              clear:
                RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES: 1
              secret:
                - RAILS_MASTER_KEY
            asset_path: /rails/public/assets
            ```

            Note:
            - It is worth noting that my app has no dependent services
            - But you can add mysql or redis here too
            - Under an accessories key
            ---
            ## Setup

            ```sh
            > git add .
            > git commit -m "Add kamal"
            > git push
            ```

            Note:
            - That's it for configuration
            - Commit that and you're done
            - And then we can finally setup kamal
            ---
            ## Setup

            ```sh
            > sudo systemctl start docker
            > export KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=dckr_pat_xxxxxxxx
            ```

            Note:
            - Kamal needs to use docker, so make sure its started
            - You can also just start docker desktop
            - It needs to login too, so feed it an access token
            ---
            ## Setup

            ```sh
            > kamal setup
            Running /usr/bin/env mkdir -p .kamal on x.x.x.x
            Finished in 1.585 seconds with exit status 0 (successful).
            Acquiring the deploy lock...
            Ensure Docker is installed...
            Running docker -v on x.x.x.x
            Finished in 0.342 seconds with exit status 0 (successful).
            Log into image registry...
            Running docker --version && docker buildx version as gannon@localhost

            Build and push app image...
            Running docker --version && docker buildx version as gannon@localhost
            ```

            Note:
            - This prepares the server for hosting
            - Installs docker, sets up the web server
            - That sort of thing
            ---
            ## Setup

            ```sh
            > kamal setup
            Running /usr/bin/env mkdir -p .kamal on x.x.x.x
            Finished in 1.585 seconds with exit status 0 (successful).
            Acquiring the deploy lock...
            Ensure Docker is installed...
            Running docker -v on x.x.x.x
            Finished in 0.342 seconds with exit status 0 (successful).
            Log into image registry...
            Running docker --version && docker buildx version as gannon@localhost
            Finished in 0.248 seconds with exit status 0 (successful).
            Running docker login -u [REDACTED] -p [REDACTED] as gannon@localhost
            Finished in 0.665 seconds with exit status 0 (successful).
            Running docker login -u [REDACTED] -p [REDACTED] on x.x.x.x
            Finished in 0.296 seconds with exit status 0 (successful).
            Build and push app image...
            Running docker --version && docker buildx version as gannon@localhost
            ```

            Note:
            - It also does the first deploy
            - So your project will be deployed post setup
            - If everything is right, you'll see your app
            ---
            ## Setup

            ```sh
            > kamal deploy
            Log into image registry...
            Running docker --version && docker buildx version as gannon@localhost
            Finished in 0.248 seconds with exit status 0 (successful).
            Running docker login -u [REDACTED] -p [REDACTED] as gannon@localhost
            Finished in 0.665 seconds with exit status 0 (successful).
            Running docker login -u [REDACTED] -p [REDACTED] on x.x.x.x
            Finished in 0.296 seconds with exit status 0 (successful).
            Build and push app image...
            Running docker --version && docker buildx version as gannon@localhost
            ```

            Note:
            - For future deploys, run kamal deploy
            - It will just do the deployment part
            ---
            ## Demo

            Note:
            - That might not look easy
            - Let's look at Kamal in action
            - And try to deploy my app to a brand new server
            ---
